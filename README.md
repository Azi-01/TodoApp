## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)

### What I learned

- How to manage states in react.
- How to use those states to display different data.
- How to store states in local storage.
- Using third party react libraries. 


### Continued development

As there are no animations in this project, so in the future I would like to learn about animations and add them to my future projects.
